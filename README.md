# The outline of the plan

The notebooks will describe the following:
1. The traditional PINN model, as described by Raissi. In other words: differential equations in the loss function.
2. UDE models, mostly physical models with an NN to correct errors/biases. Includes PYBAMM demonstration.
3. Physical features and synthetic data. This is the part I'm the most unsure about as of now.,


The data folder originates from the Wang et al 2024 Nature article. This is a test to see if this is working on my desktop machine.
